I Want To Become A Software Engineer

Hi my name is Ivan Lee, you can call me Ivan. I live in Malaysia. I wrote this when I was 16 years old and today the date is 20/5/2021. My dream was to become a Software Engineer. I started coding 13/5/2021. The coding language I learn is Python 3.

Q : Why do you get into coding?

A : First, when I was like 10 years old I wanted to become a banker because I was inspired by my mom and dad. My mom and dad is working in a bank so I was inspired. When I was growing up, I suddenly didn't want to become a banker but a gamer because I think that playing games can give me excitement and joy. In 2020, covid-19 strike in Malaysia. Malaysia have a lockdown and that time school didn't have online classes. So that time I keep playing game non-stop till 2021. In 2021, school open I played less game and study a little. In 2021 May, Malaysia have MCO3.0(Movement Control Order) and school closed again but they have online classes. That time I was bored in playing video games and I wanted to find something intresting to learn and I found coding. I looked up "What is coding" in youtube and google. Then, I found out alot of coding languages and I found out what the coding language can do. Example: Python can do web development, software development and that inspired me. That's how I get into coding. 


Q : What website you used to learn Python 3?

A : I learned in the website called Codecademy. Codecademy is a really good website to learn Python 3 or other coding languages. You will learn about what the topic is for and         inside the topic. When you finish learning about the topic they will give small project or quizz to do. I highly recommend this website for all those beginners who want to         learn coding but dont know where to start.  


Q : Why do you learn Python 3 as a starting coding language?

A : I want to learn Python 3 as a starting coding language because it is easier to remember and not very complicated.
